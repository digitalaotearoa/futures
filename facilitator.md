### Workshop Facilitators

To create a consistent base-level of workshop faciltiators, we've developed
a workshop facilitator train-the-trainer workshop that can help our workshop
hosts to learn the specific techniques we'll be using to run our Futures 
workshops

Our workshop facilitator training will invite participants to join a
community of practice, composed of facilitators from across NZ that will
work to apply common methods and practices to capture and gather these
optimistic and pessimistic views of the future at 15, 30, and 50 year
time horizons.

Over the span of 4-hours (in 2x 2-hour sessions online via Zoom)
prospective facilitators will join group discussions and break-out rooms
to discuss and share techniques and tips for:

-   Creating safe spaces for contribution
-   Ice breakers and group formation
-   Keeping a room focused and "on-task"
-   Making space for unique perspectives and minority voices
-   Channeling Optimism
-   Focusing Contributions - i.e.Â A day in the life, 50 years from now?
-   Inviting Pessimism
-   Future Scenarios as a lasting resource - How to capture futures created and contribute them to GitHub
