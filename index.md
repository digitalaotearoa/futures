# Overview

Over the course of 2022 we are exploring and gathering over 100
futurescapes. Contributions will be curated from diverse community
perspectives across Aotearoa, New Zealand.

They will be shared openly as a resource to better understand the
opportunities and challenges of a pivot toward digital delivery of
Aotearoa's systems of civic and cultural governance to ensure a thriving
environment, society and economy.

While digitising the delivery of services currently provided by the
public sector can streamline many things for many people, it can also
exacerbate cultural, generational, economic and digital divides. It is
our hope that through exploring possible futures
we can understand both the challenges and opportunities present
immediately and deep into the future.

Imagine what might be possible if Aotearoa were to have a vibrant,
user-focused and trustworthy digital infrastructure for governance,
appropriately and effectively developed and maintained by citizens.

An infrastructure to which citizens are happy to contribute and
understand how they benefit from their investment of data, information,
knowledge and expertise to create friction-free governance services that
enrich the lives of all our people. Then, for a moment, imagine things
"going to custard", the proverbial pendulum swinging the other way, what
are the ways in which a government could demand and capture citizen data
and use it for nefarious purposes and make life in Aotearoa unbearable
for all or some. Our optimistic and pessimistic futures workshops aim to
create space for these conversations and to draw diverse perspectives
out of all kinds of people who live, work and contribute in New Zealand.
Participating in this initiative, as a supporting organisation, as a
participant, or as a facilitator are all incredibly valuable ways for us
to co-create the future for digital Aotearoa we want to see.

### Gathering and Sharing Futures as Open Data

We will work through 2022 to facilitate workshops (online and in-person as possible)
which gather and collect unique perspectives on what the hopes, dreams
and fears are about a more connected digital government of the future.
What opportunities can we collectively head toward, what sand-pits and
dangers can we avoid. We hope that through this exercise we can invite
us all to co-create the future, balanced betwen brave optimisim and cautious pessimim, in
hopes that in-between these extremes we can map the future we want to
head towards together.

Workshops will strive to develop ways that we can capture
contributions from community members. Through participant's written,
spoken, transcribed and multimedia contributions, we'll catalog and
organise these futures into a resource that can become a reference data
set for alignment of the digital society and government of Aotearoa we'd
like to see. This can act as inspiration, an inventory of possibilities and
a reference for our work and its possible impacts.

Select futures will become the anchor for a multimedia VR experience to
be delivered at the end of 2022. This Virtual Reality future will allow
anyone to have an opportunity to wear VR goggles and "walk into" a
future we've co-created together. 

### Core workshops 

Our primary mechanism for funding these workshops is to partner with
organizations that can benefit from this library of possible and
avoidable futures. If your organization is thinking about how it
undergoes a digital transformation, or how the pivot to digital will
work in 15, 30, 50 years, we want your involvement and participation.

*This work is part of a larger work program "G0V (Gov Zero) Aotearoa" considering the people, tools and systems which will
enable a productive digital future for the public service in New
Zealand. Through this work we hope to demonstrate a public commons for
legislation represented as code using high-value use-case and a Service
Aotearoa demonstrator which demonstrates what\'s possible when service
offerings of government are shared and delivered with low friction in
digital ways.*
